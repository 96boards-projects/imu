# IMU-MPU6050 interfacing

This project shows how to interface **6 DoF IMU** (Intertial Measurement Unit) with 96Boards. Sensor value will be read by a C program and passed to a Python script which does 
3D rendering with the help of **OpenGL** and **pygame**. This allows us to visualize the rotation about X and Y axes graphically. Unix socket is used for 
IPC (Inter Process Communication) between C and Python processes.

# 1. Hardware

## 1.1 Hardware Requirements:

1. [DragonBoard 410c](http://www.96boards.org/product/dragonboard410c/)
2. [Power Supply](https://www.amazon.com/Adapter-Regulated-Supply-Copper-String/dp/B015G8DZK2)
2. [Sensors Mezzanine](http://www.96boards.org/product/sensors-mezzanine/)
3. [MPU6050 IMU](https://www.tindie.com/products/onehorse/gy-521-mpu-6050-breakout-board/)

## 1.2 Hardware Setup:

First, connect the Sensors Mezzanine to DragonBoard410c via low-speed expansion connector. Then, connect **MPU6050** to **I2C0** of Sensors Mezzanine.

# 2. Software

## 2.1 Operating System

- [Linaro Debian based OS (latest)](https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/ConsumerEdition/DragonBoard-410c/Downloads/Debian.md)

## 2.2 Package Dependencies
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install libmraa-dev python-opengl python-pygame
```

# 3. Building and Running:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/96boards-projects/imu.git      
$ cd projects/imu																													
$ make
```
Now, hold the sensor in horizontal manner and run the generated binary as a background process
	
```shell
$ sudo ./imu&
```
Next, invoke the python script to visualize IMU data

```shell
$ sudo python visualize.py
```
# 4. Conclusion:

Sensor can be moved about X and Y axes so that the tile on display also moves accordingly. Simply close the pygame window to exit both processes gracefully.

Before running the binary again, delete */tmp/socket* as below:

```shell
$ sudo rm -rf /tmp/socket
```
